												<h3>Warehouses</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Unprecedented changes are threatening to upend the quality of life in our valley. The cities of Hemet and San Jacinto are now <a href="https://www.hemetca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/9614/Notice-of-Preparation?bidId=">considering</a> the development of giant logistics warehouses. These are massive buildings of a million square feet and more, designed to unload, store, sort and reload merchandise on semi trailers (aka 18 wheelers). Including the San Jacinto Commerce Center,  we are looking at over 15 million square feet of warehouse space. This area is only the buildings, and does not include the vast parking lot surrounding them. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146519300985">traffic</a> of diesel trucks to and from these warehouses, and the  movement of trailers inside their yards, will continue 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  A low estimate for the number of trucks going in and out daily will be over 8,000. This traffic may have low times and peak hours. The experience of driving in Hemet and San Jacinto will forever change. These trucks spew <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GH001091">exhaust</a> that has been found to contain PM 2.5 (tiny particles that enter deep into the lungs and even enter into cells), Nitrous Oxide (converted to ground level ozone in sunlight, a serious irritant,) and of course Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. While truck exhaust is getting a bit cleaner with new regulations, research is only beginning to reveal the pollution caused by tire particles and brake dust, which accumulate in the long dry summer.  </p>

												<h3>Community Gardens</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Community garden projects in Hemet and San Jacinto are blossoming into vital spaces for environmental education, food security, and neighborhood connection.
												These gardens empower residents to grow their own produce, share knowledge, and build a greener, more resilient community.												
												Community spaces not only promote sustainable living but also strengthen community bonds, giving an outlet for all residents.
												The Green Coalition actively supports these efforts, collaborating with local groups to enhance food accessibility and environmental stewardship throughout the valley.</p>

												<h3>Green Waste</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Green Coalition of the San Jacinto Valley is actively engaged in green waste initiatives aimed at reducing landfill waste and promoting sustainable practices within our community.
												In collaboration with the City of Hemet, we recently organized a free compost giveaway, distributing 40 yards of compost to residents to encourage organic recycling and soil enrichment.
												By supporting composting programs and educating the public on proper green waste disposal, we aim to foster a cleaner, more sustainable environment for the San Jacinto Valley.</p>

												<h3>Climate Change</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Green Coalition addresses climate change at the local level through community-driven environmental projects and advocacy.
												By opposing warehouse sprawl and promoting smart land use, we help reduce emissions linked to traffic congestion, air pollution, and habitat destruction.
												Our tree planting and greening efforts improve carbon sequestration, lower urban heat, and enhance local biodiversity.
												We support bike lane proposals and alternative transportation planning, encouraging lower-emission travel options within the San Jacinto Valley.
												Through public education and outreach, we raise awareness about climate change impacts and empower residents to take action in their own lives.
												Each of our initiatives—from composting and waste reduction to equitable access to green space—works toward building a more climate-resilient community for all.</p>

												<h3>Building Electrification</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We support a just and sustainable energy transition by promoting electrification and cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.
												We educate the community about available rebates and incentive programs for electric vehicles, home electrification, and energy-efficient appliances.
												Through outreach and partnerships, we help residents access resources to switch from gas to electric systems, including induction cooktops, heat pumps, and solar power.
												Our advocacy encourages local governments to adopt policies that support clean energy infrastructure and equitable access to new technologies.
												By empowering residents to make informed energy choices, we help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance long-term environmental and public health goals.
												These efforts are part of our broader mission to create a cleaner, safer, and more climate-resilient San Jacinto Valley.</p>

												<h3>Public Meetings</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Green Coalition actively participates in public meetings and city council sessions to advocate for environmental sustainability in the San Jacinto Valley.
												Our members attend Hemet City Council meetings to voice concerns, propose initiatives, and collaborate with local officials on green projects.
												Through these engagements, we've influenced decisions on issues like warehouse development, bike lane proposals, and community greening efforts.
												We also organize and promote community attendance at these meetings, ensuring that residents have a platform to express their environmental concerns.
												Our presence at city council meetings underscores our commitment to civic engagement and grassroots activism.
												By maintaining open communication with local government, we strive to shape policies that reflect the community's environmental values and needs.</p>
